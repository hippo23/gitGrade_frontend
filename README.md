# Frontend code

Hey rye LMAO notes lang here para di ka maconfuse masyado LKSDJF

## Code you do not need to touch

Anything that is super complete so like the organization courses, info page, and possibly HR panel don't need much touching up on. These are the

- Error Page
- Organization Courses
- Infosheet Page
- Authentication (that is actually not needed i might delete it)
- HR panel (it doesn't have much api calls though xd i just havent fixed it yet)

Everything else though is free reign. I just need the frontend really pls im dying
- The dashboard, for example, is alright. I'll be adding some course announcements features but I just need it to look okay.
- The courses for the teacher's view (course sections that are being handled -> students in the course) (you can follow the design I made or make it look better LMAO)
- The courses for the student's view (think CRS grades viewing)
- the semester selection stuff dropdown you were working on xd I just need like something intuitive for people to modify the diff semesters and academic years.
